# MIT Blueprint 2021 Project: NASA's Picture of the Day Website
This project is a [website](https://blueprint-project-2021-tan-theta.sayansisodiya.repl.co/) that display's NASA's picture of the day (using [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/)) along with a description of the image.

I created this website using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML while working with two classmates during [MIT's Blueprint 2021 Hackathon](https://blueprint.hackmit.org/). The website is hosted on Replit.
